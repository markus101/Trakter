    "shout":"This is a cult classic, which usually means that people who grew up on it love it and people who now watch it for the first time don't get what's so great about it. With this movie I'm in the second group.. Sure, there are some hilarious moments, and sure, they mock the story of Jesus and rebel against the church. But the movie moves too slow and there were too few funny moments for me to really enjoy it. Always look on the bright side of life is brilliant though!",
